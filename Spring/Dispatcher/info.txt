What is front controller in Spring MVC?
In Spring MVC DispatcherServlet act as a Front Controller for the framework and responsible 
for intercepting every request and then dispatches/forwards request to appropriate controller. 
Configure the DispatcherServlet in the web.xml file of web application and request 
which we want to be handled by DispatcherServlet should be mapped using URL mapping.

For example all the requests ending with *.do will be handled by the DispatcherServlet

<web-app>
<servlet>
<servlet-name>example</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
	<servlet-mapping>
	<servlet-name>example</servlet-name>
	<url-pattern>*.do</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
