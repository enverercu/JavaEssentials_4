Hibernate - Caching

Caching is a mechanism to enhance the performance of a system. 
It is a buffer memory that lies between the application and the database.

Cache memory stores recently used data items in order to reduce the number of database hits as much as possible.

First-level Cache
The first-level cache is the Session cache and is a mandatory cache through which all requests must pass.

The Session object keeps an object under its own power before committing it to the database.

Query-level Cache
Hibernate also implements a cache for query resultsets that integrates closely with the second-level cache.

This is an optional feature and requires two additional physical cache regions that hold the cached query results and the timestamps when a table was last updated. 
This is only useful for queries that are run frequently with the same parameters.
