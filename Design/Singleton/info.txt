whereas lazy loading mean that load the data only when required.

Eager loading fetch the data in one query whereas lazy loading fetch the data when needed by triggering the sub query.


How many ways you can write Singleton Class in Java?
Answer : I know at least four ways to implement Singleton pattern in Java

Singleton by synchronizing getInstance() method
Singleton with public static final field initialized during class loading.
Singleton generated by static nested class, also referred as Singleton holder pattern.
From Java 5 on-wards using Enums


Difference between Singleton Pattern vs Static Class in Java

it’s important to remember fundamental difference between Singleton pattern and static class, 
former gives you an Object, while later just provide static methods. 
Since an object is always much more capable than a method

Main advantage of Singleton over static is that former is more object oriented than later. 
With Singleton, you can use Inheritance and Polymorphism to extend a base class, implement an interface and capable of providing different implementations
