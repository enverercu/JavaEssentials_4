How are Observer and Observable used?
- The observable class represents an observable object.
- The object to be observed can be represented by sub-classing observable class.
- When there is a change in an observable instance, 
	an application calling the Observable's notifyObservers method causes all of its observers 
	to be notified of the change by a call to their update method.


Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified,
its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically.

Observer pattern uses three actor classes.
Subject, Observer and Client.

Subject is an object having methods to attach and detach observers to a client object.
We have created an abstract class Observer and a concrete class Subject that is extending class Observer.
