In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and
refer to newly created object using a common interface.

What is the difference between factory and abstract factory pattern?

The differences between factory and abstract factory are following:

- Factory pattern is a single method but abstract factory is an object.
- The Abstract Factory pattern is one level of abstraction higher than the factory pattern.
- Factory pattern generally returns the common parent class or method 
  whereas the abstract factory pattern returns the one of the several factories.
